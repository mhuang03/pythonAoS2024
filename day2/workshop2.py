# Problem 1: No Numbers or Vowels
# Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints the string without any numbers or vowels.
# For example, if the user enters "Hello 123 World", the program should print "Hll Wrld".
# Hint: Use a loop to iterate over the characters in the string and check if each character is a number or a vowel.



# Problem 2: Triangle
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints a triangle with n rows.
# For example, if the user enters 5, the program should print:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# Hint: Use nested loops to print the rows of the triangle. Use print(text, end='') to print on the same line.



# Problem 3: Word Count
# Write a program that asks the user for some words, then counts each unique word and prints the count.
# Hint: Use a dictionary to store the counts of each word.



# Problem 4: Look and Say
# The look-and-say sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term is generated from the previous term.
# The first term is 1. To generate the next term, read the previous term and count the number of digits in each group of the same digit.
# For example, the first 5 terms are:
# 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221
# "one", "one one", "two one(s)", "one two, one one", "one one, one two, two one(s)"
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the first n terms of the look-and-say sequence.
# Hint: It might be more convenient to work with strings instead of numbers for this problem.

# Problem 1: FizzBuzz
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints:
# - "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
# - "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
# - "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
# - The number itself if it is neither divisible by 3 nor 5.
# For example, if the user enters 15, the program should print "FizzBuzz".
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%).



# Problem 2: Factorial
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then calculates the factorial of that number.
# The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
# For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
# Hint: Use a loop to multiply the numbers from 1 to n together.



# Problem 3: Fibonacci
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints the first n Fibonacci numbers.
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
# For example, the first 5 Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.
# Hint: Use some variables to keep track of the previous 2 Fibonacci numbers.



# Problem 4: No Numbers or Vowels
# Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints the string without any numbers or vowels.
# For example, if the user enters "Hello 123 World", the program should print "Hll Wrld".
# Hint: Use a loop to iterate over the characters in the string and check if each character is a number or a vowel.



# Problem 5: Triangle
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints a triangle with n rows.
# For example, if the user enters 5, the program should print:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
# Hint: Use nested loops to print the rows of the triangle. Use print(text, end='') to print on the same line.

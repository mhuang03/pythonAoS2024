# Problem 1: FizzBuzz
# Write a program that asks the user for a number n and then prints:
# - "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
# - "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
# - "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
# - The number itself if it is neither divisible by 3 nor 5.
# For example, if the user enters 15, the program should print "FizzBuzz".
# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%).

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
elif num % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
elif num % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
else:
    print(num)
